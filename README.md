# Interactive Children's Exercise Program

## Overview
Welcome to the Interactive Children's Exercise Program! This Bash script is designed to provide educational exercises for children based on their age group. It covers arithmetic, language, ethics, and technology topics. The program prompts the user to answer questions and provides feedback on their responses.

## Requirements
- This program runs on Unix-like systems with Bash installed.
- It requires terminal capabilities to display colored text (ANSI escape sequences).

## Usage
1. **Running the Program:**
   - Execute the script in a terminal: `./interactive_program.sh`
   - Follow the prompts to enter your name and age.
   - Answer the questions presented based on your age category.

2. **Age Categories and Exercises:**
   - **3-5 years old:** Includes basic arithmetic (addition), simple language questions, ethics (choosing good behaviors), and basic technology understanding (identifying TV as a source of cartoons).
   - **6-9 years old:** Includes more complex arithmetic (addition with larger numbers), language (sentence completion), ethics (handling bullying situations), and technology (identifying educational applications).
   - **10-12 years old:** Covers advanced arithmetic (multiplication), language (identifying adjectives), ethics (understanding integrity), and technology (recognizing programming languages).

3. **Feedback:**
   - After each exercise, the program provides immediate feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
   - Children are encouraged to try again if they answer incorrectly, promoting learning through practice.

## Customization
- You can modify the questions, answer choices, and correct answers in the script (`interactive_program.sh`) to suit different educational content or languages.

## Notes
- Ensure your terminal supports ANSI escape sequences for colored text display.
- For educational purposes, consider tailoring exercises to suit local curriculum or additional learning goals.
